What to Keep and What to Drop: Adaptive Table Filtering Framework
arXiv preprint (cs.CL), 2025
June. 2025 – July. 2025
◦ Proposed a modular and model-agnostic framework, ATF (Adaptive Table Filtering), to compress large and noisy tables in TableQA.
◦ Designed column-level and row-level filters using LLM-generated descriptions, semantic relevance scoring, and K-means clustering.
◦ Achieved up to 70% input reduction while improving out-of-domain performance on Open-WikiTable (EM +1.8%, F1 +1.3%) and AIT-QA (EM +35.4%, F1 +30.8%).
◦ Demonstrated that ATF enables smaller models (e.g., TAPAS-base) to match or surpass larger models (e.g., TAPAS-large) without additional fine-tuning.
◦ Published results showing task-specific trade-offs, highlighting ATF's strength in generalization for real-world TableQA.
